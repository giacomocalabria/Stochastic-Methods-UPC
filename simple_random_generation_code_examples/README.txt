#     Code implementing a Monte Carlo program (Fortran and Python) to compute the expectation values of 
#     two given functions of a random variale x.
#
#     The random variable x has uniform distribution probability in the 0<= x <= 1 domain.
#
#     the expectation value of two functions is calculated, for the cases:
#
#     a)  f(x)  =  Exp(-x)
#
#     b)  f(x) = x   if  x^2 > 1/4        ,     f(x) = 1/2 otherwise
#
