    "# Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation for AWGN channel\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is an important parameter in digital communication. It is defined as the ratio of the power of a signal to the power of background noise. In this notebook, we will simulate the performance of a simple communication system over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. The system consists of a transmitter, a receiver, and a channel. The transmitter sends a binary message to the receiver. The message is encoded using a simple repetition code. The receiver decodes the message using Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding. The channel introduces noise to the transmitted signal. The noise is modeled as a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and a given variance. The performance of the system is measured in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The MCMC method is a powerful tool for simulating complex systems. It is based on the concept of Markov chains. A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables where the probability of each variable depends only on the previous variable. The MCMC method generates samples from a probability distribution by constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. In this notebook, we will use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the transmitted message given the received signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "1. Transmitter: The transmitter encodes the binary message using a repetition code.\n",
    "2. Channel: The channel introduces noise to the transmitted signal.\n",
    "3. Receiver: The receiver decodes the received signal using ML decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining the necessary functions for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transmitter\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmitter encodes the binary message using a repetition code. The repetition code is a simple error-correcting code that repeats the message multiple times. In this simulation, we will use a repetition code with a repetition factor of 3. The transmitter takes a binary message as input and repeats each bit three times to create the transmitted signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmitter function is defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def transmitter(message):\n",
    "    return np.repeat(message, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "The channel introduces noise to the transmitted signal. The noise is modeled as a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and a given variance. The channel function takes the transmitted signal and the noise variance as input and adds Gaussian noise to the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The channel function is defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def channel(signal, noise_var):\n",
    "    noise = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(noise_var), len(signal))\n",
    "    return signal + noise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "The receiver decodes the received signal using ML decoding. The ML decoding algorithm calculates the likelihood of each possible message and selects the message with the highest likelihood as the decoded message. In this simulation, we will calculate the likelihood of each possible message given the received signal and select the message with the highest likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The receiver function is defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def receiver(received_signal):\n",
    "    decoded_message = np.zeros(len(received_signal) // 3, dtype=int)\n",
    "    for i in range(len(received_signal) // 3):\n",
    "        block = received_signal[i * 3:(i + 1) * 3]\n",
    "        decoded_message[i] = np.argmax(np.bincount(block))\n",
    "    return decoded_message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the transmitter, channel, and receiver functions, we can proceed with the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation, we will generate a random binary message, encode it using the transmitter, add noise using the channel, and decode the received signal using the receiver. We will repeat this process multiple times to estimate the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation parameters are as follows:\n",
    "- Message length: 1000\n",
    "- Noise variance: 0.1\n",
    "- Number of iterations: 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation steps are as follows:\n",
    "1. Generate a random binary message of length 1000.\n",
    "2. Encode the message using the transmitter.\n",
    "3. Add noise to the transmitted signal using the channel.\n",
    "4. Decode the received signal using the receiver.\n",
    "5. Calculate the Bit Error Rate (BER) by comparing the decoded message with the original message.\n",
    "\n",
